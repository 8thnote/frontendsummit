- one:
  - basic grunt setup
    - npm init
    - grunt-cli
    - grunt-contrib-concat
    - grunt-sass
    - create Gruntfile.js
    - switch to 1-setup
    - explore Gruntfile.js
    - run grunt
- two:
  - add jshint
  - add load-grunt-tasks instead of loading more tasks
  - customize jshint with options
    - jshint fails, update the options to allow it to pass
  - external settings
    - change dist to app
- three: organize
  - want to enhance my sass/css more with watch and lint,
  - but organize first
  - create grunt_tasks folder
    - walk through sass.js and javascript.js
    - use config vars as well as local vars
- four: specialize
  - Strict vs Lax
  - Build vs Watch
  - Tasks
    notsoawesome (set up a bunch of tasks)
    awesome (single task, call different targets)
    moreAwesome (single tasks, single target, change value)
